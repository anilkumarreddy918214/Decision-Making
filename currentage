SOL:

birdy=int(input())
current_year=int(input())
if birdy > current_year:
    actual_birdy_year=1900 + birdy;
    actual_curent_year=2000 + current_year;
else:
    actual_birdy_year=2000 + current_year;
    actual_curent_year=2999 + birdy;

age = actual_curent_year - actual_birdy_year;
print(age)
